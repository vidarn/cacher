* Clean things up
    - The file format should look like this:
        - version, num_verts, num_faces
        - vert data (compressed)
        - face data (compressed)
    - The cached frame should mirror this structure
    - First version: load all the data from the file into memory and then create the cached frame
    // What good woud this do? * Second version: try using a memory map to avoid reading everything twice
    * When loading a frame, take a cached frame and a mesh and set the right things
* Progress update
* Check out what happend when saving/loading/deleting
* Fix spinners
* Resize logo
* Support more data
* Try using Blosc for compression

--- TODO ---
* Support more data
    * UVW coordinates
    - Material ID
* File sequencer
* Clean things up
    - The file format should look like this:
        - version, num_verts, num_faces
        - vert data (compressed)
        - face data (compressed)
    - The cached frame should mirror this structure
    - First version: load all the data from the file into memory and then create the cached frame
    * Second version: try using a memory map to avoid reading everything twice // What good would this do? 
    * When loading a frame, take a cached frame and a mesh and set the right things
- Check out what happens with the memory when saving/loading/deleting
- Fix spinners
- Progress update
